## Start here

1. To get a feeling what preCICE does, watch a [short presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCv2FNUvKA8), a [longer training session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCv2FNUvKA8), or [click through a tutorial in your browser](http://run.precice.org/).
2. Get and install preCICE. For Linux systems, this is pretty easy. Just pick what suits you best on [this overview page](installation-overview.html). Facing any problems? [Ask for help](community-channels.html).
    - For example, [download](https://github.com/precice/precice/releases/latest) and install our binary package for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) by clicking on it or using the following commands:
    ```shell
    wget https://github.com/precice/precice/releases/download/v2.2.0/libprecice2_2.2.0_focal.deb
    sudo apt install ./libprecice2_2.2.0_focal.deb
    ```
3. Build and couple two [C++ solverdummies](https://github.com/precice/precice/tree/master/examples/solverdummies/cpp).
4. You probably want to couple a solver you are already using, such as OpenFOAM. Since many of our tutorials use it, [install OpenFOAM](adapter-openfoam-support.html).
5. Download and install the [OpenFOAM-preCICE adapter](adapter-openfoam-get.html).
6. [Couple OpenFOAM with OpenFOAM](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/wiki/Tutorial-for-CHT:-Flow-over-a-heated-plate). This testcase is part of the OpenFOAM adapter.
